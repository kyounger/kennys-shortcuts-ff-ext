# kennys-shortcuts-ff-ext

A quick Firefox extension that Reopens Containers with keyboard shortcuts for my "Work" and "Personal" containers.

This could probably be extended to a generic extension, but yeah, time.

### Use
Run `AMO_JWT_ISSUER=***** AMO_JWT_SECRET=******* ./build.sh` (uses docker) to produce the xpi extension. Drop that into `about:addons`.
